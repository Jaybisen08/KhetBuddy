# 🌾 KHETBUDDY: Unified AI-Agri Ecosystem
> **"Empowering Bharat's Backbone through High-Precision Intelligence & Shared Prosperity."**

KhetBuddy is a world-class, multi-lingual digital portal designed for the modern Indian farmer. Submitted for a state-level hackathon, this platform bridges the gap between scientific agronomy and ground-level farming through Gemini-powered AI, predictive analytics, and a decentralized resource economy.

## 🚀 Core Intelligence Modules

### 1. 🤖 Krishi Mitra AI (Professional Scientific Advisor)
A state-of-the-art conversational agent powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**. 
*   **Scientific Precision**: Provides data-backed advice on dosages, soil nutrition, and pest management.
*   **Voice-First UI**: Features a robust Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine supporting 6+ regional languages.
*   **Safety Fix**: Includes a proprietary "Speech Tracking Mechanism" to prevent autonomous repetition, ensuring the AI only speaks when explicitly commanded.

### 2. 🗺️ Weather Intelligence & Risk Analytics
A full-scale GIS mapping interface integrated with **Leaflet.js**.
*   **Neural Analysis**: A dedicated "Analyze" engine that visualizes 9 distinct weather zones (Heat Waves, Cyclonic Disturbances, Fog/Smog, etc.) across the Indian subcontinent.
*   **Farm Registry**: Allows farmers to pin their specific coordinates to receive hyper-local risk tracking.
*   **Logistics Safety**: Dynamic route analysis for transporting harvests during volatile weather conditions.

### 3. 👁️ AI Diagnostic Vision
Transforming smartphones into laboratory-grade diagnostic tools.
*   **Pathogen Synthesis**: Uses Gemini Vision to identify over 400+ pests and diseases from a single leaf photograph.
*   **Integrated Remediation**: Provides a dual-protocol response—Organic remedies for sustainable farming and Scientific Chemical prescriptions with exact dilution ratios.

### 4. 📈 Neural Mandi Analytics
*   **Predictive Pricing**: Simulated Random Forest regression models that forecast commodity prices (Wheat, Onion, Tomato, etc.) for the upcoming 5–10 days.
*   **Profit Optimization**: Helps farmers decide whether to sell immediately or store their produce based on trend volatility.

### 5. 🤝 P2P Resource Grid (Sharing Economy)
*   **Equipment Rental**: A decentralized marketplace where farmers can rent out tractors, rotavators, and sprayers to neighbors.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Mechanization costs are reduced by up to 40% through community resource sharing.
